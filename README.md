### Sentiment Analysis with Twitter Data

Sentiment analysis aims to judge whether the emotional tend expressed in a text is positive or negative. Generally speaking, sentiment analysis is trying to determine the attitude of a speaker or a writer on a topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The basic task is classifying the polarity of the given text. In this project, it focused on the Tweeter, a popular microblog. The various models are built to classify the tweets into positive or negative sentiment. Before using the texts, there are several ways to pre-process the data. Moreover, then the feature extraction converts the twitter texts to a vector. There are three methods to obtain the feature: TI-IDF, TF, and FP. Moreover, the five supervised learning classifiers are implemented, including NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic regression, SVM, DecisionTrees, and KNN. Finally, the evaluation is used for these five models, and the SVM achieved the best performance.
